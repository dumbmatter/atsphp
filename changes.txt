5.1.2 - 2006-07-23
BUG FIXES
- Critical security fix for servers with magic_quotes_gpc disabled (most
  servers are not affected)
- Automatically deleting inactive members is working again
- In button.php, rank calculating ignores inactive sites
- Character encodings in the installer/upgrader now work
- Month names on the stats page are translated into the default language
  instead of always being English (this has not been extensively tested, but it
  seems to work; let me know if it doesn't)
- Ad breaks no longer break the page layout if they are directly below the
  final rank
- If there are 24 members and 10 listed per page, the multiple pages drop-down
  member will show the last page as 21-24 instead of 21-30
- Fixed some minor HTML problems
- Fixed search query display glitch (' was shown as \')

5.1.1 - 2006-06-21
BUG FIXES
- 5.1.0 used unicode for all the translations.  This caused lots of problems
  for people, so I converted the translations back to their old character
  encodings.

5.1.0 - 2006-06-16
FEATURES
- When an edit form or join form has errors in it, the user is presented with inline error messages
- RSS feed of the top 10 sites (overall and by category) via feed.php
- New admin stuff:
  - Topical links to the manual for confusing options on the settings page
  - Google-friendly links can be disabled
  - Option to email admin when a new review is posted
  - Custom pages: easily add static content to integrate with your topsites (FAQ, rules, etc.)
  - Profanity filter
  - Overall stats displayed on main page
BUG FIXES
- More robust in non-standard environments (no <?=, handles weird files in languages dir)
- Major performance increase in rankings.php for lists with lots of sites per page
- Hits in from search engines are filtered to prevent cheating
- Language list is ordered alphabetically
- Minor skin tweaks
- When a category name is edited, sites currently in that category are moved to the edited category
- Categories containing ampersands (&) work correctly
- Admin does not allow you to delete the last category
- Minor search improvements (UI and sorting)
- When users join lists that require admin approval, they are warned that they will not be listed immediately
- Uses preg_replace_callback() instead of preg_replace() to speed up skin parsing
  - 10% faster skin parsing results in 1% faster overall script execution
- Got rid of g and 9 in the captcha because they look the same in the default font
